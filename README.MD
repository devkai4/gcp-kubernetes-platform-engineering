# GCP Kubernetes Platform Engineering

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform engineering on Google Cloud Platform. This repository provides a comprehensive reference implementation for building production-ready microservices infrastructure with observability, security, and automation.

## Platform Architecture
```
Google Cloud Platform
â”œâ”€â”€ GKE Autopilot/Standard Cluster
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Microservices Demo Application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Istio Service Mesh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Observability Stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
â”œâ”€â”€ VPC Network (Custom)
â”œâ”€â”€ Cloud Load Balancing
â””â”€â”€ Cloud Operations Suite
```

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Platform Foundation
- [ ] GCP infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- [ ] VPC network and security configuration
- [ ] GKE cluster setup with enterprise settings

### Phase 2: Application Platform
- [ ] Microservices application deployment
- [ ] Kubernetes resource management
- [ ] Service discovery and communication

### Phase 3: Service Mesh & Security
- [ ] Istio service mesh implementation
- [ ] Traffic management and security policies
- [ ] mTLS and zero-trust networking

### Phase 4: Observability Platform
- [ ] Metrics collection with Prometheus
- [ ] Visualization with Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- [ ] Centralized logging and alerting

### Phase 5: Platform Operations
- [ ] Chaos engineering scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Incident response procedures
